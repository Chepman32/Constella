- **Rich Animations**: Powered by React Native Reanimated and React Native Skia for smooth 60-120fps animations
- **Spatial Canvas**: Infinite 2D workspace for organizing notes visually with simulated 3D effects
- **Knowledge Graph**: Interactive visualization of note relationships and connections
- **Time Travel**: Version history with cinematic timeline scrubbing
- **Intelligent Auto-formatting**: Smart templates and formatting based on content patterns
- **Focus Mode**: Distraction-free writing with ambient effects
- **Multiple Themes**: Light, Dark, Solar, and Mono themes with adaptive switching
- **Localization**: Support for 10+ languages (en, ru, es, de, fr, pt, ja, zh, ko, uk)
- **Gesture-Based Interactions**: Draw shapes to trigger actions and commands
- **Premium Features**: In-app purchases for advanced functionality

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React Native (iOS focus, cross-platform compatible)
- **Animation**: React Native Reanimated v3+ for high-performance animations
- **Graphics**: React Native Skia for custom 2D graphics and drawing
- **Database**: SQLite with encryption for offline storage
